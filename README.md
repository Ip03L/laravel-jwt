## About Laravel JWT

Laravel TDD is a simple RESTful API that implements JWT authentication, built with Laravel 6.0 and [Laravel JWT package by Sean Tymon](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth).

This app contains only the auth implementation: register, login, see authenticated user and logout. Being said, this app also contains simple test suite to test the API endpoints, that can be a good starting point for test-driven API development.
